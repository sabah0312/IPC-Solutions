# IPC-Solutions (Sequential and partial-order plans)

Repository containing solutions of IPC problems from classical domains, including partial-order plans generated using 1) minimum reordering (mr) based on Muise et al. (JAIR 2016), and 2) minimum reinstantiated reordering (mrr) based on Waters et al. (IJCAI 2020).
## Solution Approaches

| Approach | Description | Key Characteristics | Origin |
|----------|------------|---------------------|--------|
| **Lama_solutions** |  Sequential Plans | satisfiable solutions using LAMA planner | LAMA (Richter et al., 2010)
| **op_solutions** | Sequential Plans | optimal solutions using LM-Cut optimal planner | LM-Cut (Helmert et al., 2009)
| **mr_opsb** | Partial-Order Plans, generated by Minimum Reordering (MR), from the solutions of LAMA | Allow reordering plan actions, encodes operator symmetry breaking constraints (OPSB) | [Muise et al. (JAIR 2015)] 
| **mrr_opsb** |  Partial-Order Plans, generated using Minimum Reinstantiated Reordering (MRR) | Allow reinstantiations of action parameters, encodes operator symmetry breaking constraints (OPSB) | [Waters et al. (IJCAI 2020)]
