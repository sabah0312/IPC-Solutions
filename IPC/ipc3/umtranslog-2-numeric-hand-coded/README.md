# UMTranslog-2 (Numeric, For Hand-Coded Planners)

## Domain Description

This is a numeric domain, but was only used for the hand-coding planners in the competition.
It is a large domain with 23 types of objects, 38 predicates, 24 functions and 38 action schemas.
Plan quality was measured by plan length (both allowing for concurrent activity and also simply counting steps).
More complex metrics would be possible.
