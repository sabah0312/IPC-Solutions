# Trucks (Preferences (Simple), Grounded)

## Domain Description

Essentially, this is a logistics domain about moving packages between locations by trucks under certain constraints.
The loading space of each truck is organized by areas:
A package can be (un)loaded onto an area of a truck only if the areas between the area under consideration and the truck door are free.
Moreover, some packages must be delivered within some deadlines.
In this domain, it is important to find good quality plans.
However, for many test problems, even finding one plan could be a rather difficult task.
